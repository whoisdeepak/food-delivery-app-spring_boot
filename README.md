I created this project as a comprehensive Food Delivery Application developed using Angular for the front end and Spring Boot microservices for the back end. 
The application seamlessly connects users with their favorite restaurants, offering a user-friendly interface to browse restaurants, their menus and place orders.

The 2 major functionalities this project demonstrates are: 
1. How an angular application communicates using HTTP REST calls with a back-end microservices application, which then pulls data from relational and non-relational databases.
2. This entire 3 tier application is then scaled in AWS Kubernetes, while being continuously integrated and continuously deployed (CICD) with the help of Jenkins and ArgoCD respectively.

The high-level architecture flow is shown below:
